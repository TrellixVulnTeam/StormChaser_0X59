Final Project Group Expectations
This should help set expectations within the group to help keep groups together and functional.

Communication with Each Other

What is the best form of communication in each scenario? (Call, Text, IM, E-Mail) How do we as a team want to handle each type of scenario?
Stuck on a problem: talk it out.  If out of office, use text or gchat.
Cool new idea: talk it out.  If out of office, use text or gchat.
Architecture change: talk it out.  If out of office, use text or gchat.
Someone is late for a meeting: let partner know via text.
What is a good expectation for when you should get a reply for each? (For example, we as a team expect phone calls to be responded to within 6 hours… etc.)
Call: an hour
Text: as soon as possible.
Gchat: as soon as possible.
E-mail: 6 hours

Time Commitment

What times of day are expected to be “project hours” for all group members? 
We will determine the day of what our working times will be with the expectation that hours may extend outside of a normal 9-5PM.
Will we be working on the project over the weekends? 
Yes.
Do any team members have time-exceptions they know about up front? What are they? 
No.
During what time of day is expected to be at MakerSquare working together? 
We will decide the day before.

Conflict Resolution

At what point do we take a conflict to instructors? (Don’t wait until it’s too late for us to help!)
If we talked and are unable to resolve the issue.
If we are not getting along as a team, how will we handle it?
Talk it out.
Generally, what causes stress for you? Answer for each group member. (For example, I get stressed when we’re doing too much talking vs. doing.)
Bethany: not meeting deadlines.
Patrick: Deadlines and multidimensional arrays.
How does each group member display stress? Answer for each group member. (For example, I display stress by getting really quiet, or agitated easily.)
Patrick zones out and focuses on the issue.
Bethany needs to take a walk and come back to the issue.
If we feel like someone is slacking, what will we do?
We’d talk about it.

Teamwork

A good workflow for Harsh & Shehzan is to work independently until someone runs into a hard problem, or something that requires creativity. Straight execution is mostly done best individually, while planning, brainstorming or problem solving is done best as a pair. This will vary from person to person, but it’s important to recognize when pairing is good and when it is not good for you as a team/pair. If one person is weaker than another in a particular area, it would be helpful to pair on that.

We suggest using Trello, GitHub Issues, or Pivotal Tracker. But definitely use something! 

When you recognize you need to pair, how will you indicate that to a team member?
We will tell them.
When you recognize it’s time for you to work individually, how will you indicate that to a team member?
We will tell them and work individually.
When we meet as a team, how will we keep track of decisions that have been made?
We whiteboard them and then track them in Wrike.
How often will we meet as a team?
Daily
How will we use Git? What’s the workflow for that?
Create new branches when adding new features and merge back up from there.
How will we divvy up tasks?
We create a list and decide who will take each task.
How will we update each other on what we’ve done or worked on?
We update as we go (and high-fives!).
How do we prioritize tasks?
When we create our list, we determine priority.

Communication with Instructors

Each team will meet with a dedicated instructor daily to check in and provide progress updates. All team members must be present for this.

When daily will our 10 minute update with Osei take place?
TBD.
How do we plan on asynchronously keeping our instructor in the loop?
Email.
How will we reach out with questions for different instructors?
Email or finding them to chat face-to-face.
